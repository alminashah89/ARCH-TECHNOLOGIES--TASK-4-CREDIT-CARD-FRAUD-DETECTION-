# 🔐 Credit Card Fraud Detection System

### Cybersecurity Internship Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning–based **Credit Card Fraud Detection System** developed as part of my internship as a **Cybersecurity Intern**.

The system analyzes transaction data and detects fraudulent activity using classification algorithms. It is designed as a defensive cybersecurity solution to help prevent financial cybercrime and reduce fraud risk in digital payment systems.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build an intelligent fraud detection model that:

* Identifies suspicious financial transactions
* Handles highly imbalanced datasets
* Minimizes false negatives (missing fraud cases)
* Supports cybersecurity risk monitoring

---

## 🛡 Why This is a Cybersecurity Project

Fraud detection is a core component of:

* Financial security systems
* Digital payment protection
* Cybercrime prevention
* Security Operations Center (SOC) monitoring

This system acts as a defensive AI layer to assist in identifying anomalous transaction behavior.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Random Forest Classifier
* Matplotlib & Seaborn

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset available on:

Kaggle (anonymized transaction dataset)

Features include:

* Transaction time
* Transaction amount
* Anonymized PCA-transformed features
* Target variable (Fraud / Normal)

---

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. Data Loading
2. Data Preprocessing

   * Feature scaling
   * Removing unnecessary columns
3. Handling Class Imbalance (using class weights)
4. Model Training (Random Forest)
5. Performance Evaluation
6. Confusion Matrix Visualization

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

The model is evaluated using:

* Confusion Matrix
* Precision
* Recall (very important for fraud detection)
* F1-Score
* ROC-AUC Score

In cybersecurity systems, **recall is prioritized** because missing a fraud case can lead to financial loss.
